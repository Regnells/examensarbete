## Description

This is a project I made as a final assigment when I studied at Nackademin. It's used to very basic user management in Microsoft on-premises Active Directory. Developed with Python using the Flask framework.
Used to learn more about the flask framework as well as LDAP management. Done with basically zero regards for security or proper user authentication.
